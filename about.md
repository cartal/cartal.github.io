I'm a Nicaraguan computational biologist working in Sarah Teichmann's [group] (http://www.teichlab.org/) at the Wellcome Sanger Institute applying statistical learning methods to cardiology, immunology and tissue repair. I'm particularly interested in how transcriptional networks shape the evolvability of a cell and how to better understand them using multiomic approahces. 

I'm a clinician by training. I did my Ph.D at Karolinska Institutet in Stockholm under Prof. Bj√∂rn Andersson supervision, studying the genome evolution of _Trypanosoma cruzi_.
