I'm a Nicaraguan computational biologist in Sarah Teichmann's [group](http://www.teichlab.org/) at the 
Wellcome Sanger Institute. I'm very interested in applying methods from the artificial intelligence field 
to multiomics datasets. 

### The scientific journey

*EMBL-EBI and Wellcome Sanger Institute* / Postdoctoral fellow
_September  2018 - PRESENT,  Cambridge, UK._

At Sarah Teichmann’s lab working with large scale, multi-omics single cell datasets and artificial intelligence methods. My research interests include the transcriptional regulation of the adult human heart, myeloid immune cells and their interaction during heart injury repair.  At the same time, I’m working in the deployment of state-of-the-art single cell analysis tools for the Human Cell Atlas web portal at EMBL-EBI.  

*The Francis Crick Institute* / Postdoctoral fellow
_September  2016 - September 2018,  London, UK._

I worked in the Malaria immunology laboratory using machine learning methods applied to RNA-Seq and proteomic data, as well as publicly available datasets, to study the immunological processes involved during malaria infection in a mouse model with Plasmodium chabaudi. 

*London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine* / Visiting researcher
_June 2015 - September 2016,  London, UK._

I worked with Michael Miles at the LSHTM on genome analysis of Leishmania Spp. and Trypanosoma cruzi hybrids. I also worked in the development of diagnostic tools for Strongyloides spp. using proteomic and genomic public datasets.  

*Cell and Molecular Biology, Karolinska Institutet* / Ph.D student
_March 2012 - September 2016,  Stockholm, Sweden._

I studied genomic variation in clinical and field isolates of Trypanosoma cruzi with Bjӧrn Andersson. I also worked in the development of analysis pipelines for single cell RNA-Seq of immune cells with statistical learning methods with Jonas Frisén. I also assembled and annotated the Pleurodeles waltl genome, used as a model for regeneration with András Simon. Besides the computational work, I also gained experience with DNA and RNA NGS library preparation. 

*Science for Life Laboratory (SciLifeLab)* / Bioinformatician
_January 2011 -  March 2012,  Stockholm, Sweden._

I worked as a bioinformatician for the Spruce Genome Consortium testing and developing assembly methods for large genomes and comparative genomics of conifers.  During this period I gained experience on programming languages and high-throughput computational tools.




I did my Ph.D at Karolinska Institutet in Stockholm under Prof. Björn Andersson supervision (2012 - 2016), 
studying the genome evolution of [_Trypanosoma cruzi_](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/283531v2), 
the assembly of two of the largest genomes: [_Picea abies_](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature12211) 
and [_Pleurodeles waltl_](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-01964-9), among other projects.

I did a postdoc at the Francis Crick Institute in London with Jean Langhorne (2016 - 2018), working on host-pathogen interactions during malaria infection in a mouse model, focusing on [cerebral malaria](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep39258) and the early immune response to [infection](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-52388-y).

In 2018 I started my postdoc with Sarah Teichmann, were I got involved in multiple areas of the Human Cell Atlas project. I'm currently working on the cell atlas of the adult human heart (Coming soon!), with a special interest in the mechanisms of transcriptional regulation and cell-cell interactions during cardiac tissue repair.
