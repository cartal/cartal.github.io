I'm a Nicaraguan computational biologist in Sarah Teichmann's [group](http://www.teichlab.org/) at the Wellcome Sanger Institute working on cardiology, immunology and tissue repair. I'm very interested applying methods from the artificial intelligence field for the analysis of multiomics datasets, in order to ultimate better understand how transcriptional networks shape the evolvability of a cell and tissue. 

I did my Ph.D at Karolinska Institutet in Stockholm under Prof. Bj√∂rn Andersson supervision (2012 - 2016), studying the genome evolution of [_Trypanosoma cruzi_](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/283531v2), the assembly of two of the largest genomes: [_Picea abies_](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature12211) and [_Pleurodeles waltl_](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-01964-9), among [others](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=Talavera-L%C3%B3pez+C&cauthor_id=31645299) projects.

I did a short postdoc at the Francis Crick Institute in London with Jean Langhorne (2016 - 2018), working on host-pathogen interactions during malaria infection in a mouse model, focusing on [cerebral malaria](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep39258) and the early immune response to [infection](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-52388-y).
